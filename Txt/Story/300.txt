A few horses whinny in their stalls as they feed on hay.

(2,1)
A cow moos loudly as a farmhand milks it. A bucket
with a ladle is there for drinking.

(2,2)
There is a bed stuffed with hay, made up for you to sleep in.

You are at the door of The Red Brick General Store. They sell 
clothing, weapons, armor, and potions.

(0,1)
The floor boards have been smashed through and the wall is 
scorched. A wyrm had attacked a few weeks ago and 
burned some of the merchandise.

You see several racks of clothing and armor made of different 
protective materials.

You overhear some worried villagers by the shop window.

"Did you hear, there was a sighting somewhere in the market. 
No one knows what that horrid monster was but I hope that 
the old woman who saw it was only seeing things!" a homely 
woman says. 

"I hope so as well. Wolves have been attacking our farm and 
breaking into the chicken coop. One even bit my poor boy last 
night!" another woman laments.

You pass by more villagers and patrons to the shop.

You are at the tree arch at the foot of the Great Wood. 
The fog is still present but not as thick as before.

You see a skull and a pile of bones hiding under a bush. 
They look like that of a dog's. You stay viligant as you trek 
through the forest.

Great! You find bushes covered in wild blackberries and 
raspberries. They look juicy and ripe enough to eat! Under 
the bushes, you see a bottled potion unopened and unused.

You come upon a cave a the foot of a mountain. You peer inside 
but can see nothing. You vaguely hear the squeaks of bats. You 
back away, hoping you did not disturb them.

An old willow tree stands tall in the forest. Half of it is rotting 
and the other half is alive with full healthy foliage. You draw 
near and find the cause, a black sword, oozing with evil. A 
black goo seeps out of the tree, killing the grass under it. You 
leap back and hurry away. That is the sword of a dark knight 
and should not be taken lightly.

(1,2)
A small enclosed graveyard filled with wooden crosses is before 
you. You quickly pay your respects but you notice that some of 
the graves are empty.

A fallen tree serves as a bridge over ariver but it disappears 
into a thicker portion of the fog. 

(2,1)
A small river rushes past. The water is cool and refreshing.

(2,2)
You see a group of young boys fishing at a nearby fishing spot.

"Hey, I know you!" one of the boy cries, "You're the knight 
who will save the village!"

"Beware, a dark knight passed through here not too long ago." 
another boy warned. 

You nod, thanking them for the warning, and continuing on.
