As you walk back into the village square, crowds of villagers surround
you, cheering. Young mothers hand their babies for you to kiss on the head. 
Young men offer buckets of produce, freshly picked from their farms. Fathers
are even offering the daughter's hands in marriage while young children implore
you to teach them how to be a great knight just like you! The parade slowly leads 
you to the mayor's house. He and his family step out and shake your hand. The
mayor pulls you out in front of the crowd and commences his speech, the crowds
dying down.

"It was not long ago that our small village was brimming with monsters and 
creatures alike, pillaging and killing our own. But then, this traveling knight,
a godsend wandered into our village and agreed to save us from our plight.
Today, we can rejoice as the horrid monsters and creatures that once afflicted 
our village are no more!" the mayor says as he rests a hand on your shoulder. 

He then grabs something from a pillow his wife is holding and turns to you.

"For your bravery and courage in singlehandedly saving our village, I present to you
a medal of honor!" The mayor slips a golden metal over your head before 
shaking your hand. He then turns to the crowd and raises your arm. The crowd
roars in cheers.

"Tonight, we celebrate in the open field! Prepare! Bring your best produce, your
best meats, your best foodstuffs that you can find! Musicians, prepare your
instruments!" The crowd disperses, eager to prepare.

Night soon comes and the feast is incredible. So many types of food are presented
on a long table, with you as the honored guest. There's music, dancing, and drinks
overflowing. You smile as you look at all the villagers, celebrating and feasting in your honor.

Mission complete.
