Welcome to the game!
Your mission is simple: 

You are a wandering knight that comes upon a small village in the woods.
Unfortunately, this village is being terrorized by local monsters and creatures.
The village mayor has asked you to exterminate all them for a grand prize.
Stay alive, get rid of the monsters, and you win!


In order to make your way through the game you will make heavy use of menus. 
When presented with a series of options, simply type the 
option number which corresponds to the action you'd like to take.

Exmaple: if you'd like to choose option "[3]", simply type '3' and press enter. 

At any input prompt in the game you could type "menu" and press enter to bring up the "game menu". 
The game menu is the place where you can view your character information ("view character sheet"), 
view your inventory ("view inventory sheet"), save your game, or quit the game.

Have fun and thank you for playing!
